Hi, I’m @soytak
I like programming in general and always learning something
The world is so big, yet so obscure, that's why I am a Joker of all trade.
I have hope for a tommorow, even if it can be hard to see one sometimes.

<span style="font-size:0.2em;">I'll make my three dream game one day, one day... AND THAT DAY IS NOW.</span>
